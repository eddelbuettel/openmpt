[Modarchive](https://www.modarchive.org) is a decades old archive containing
thousands of module files. It is maintained and operated by a team of volunteers,
and is funded with donations. It contains a diversity of module file formats and
music genres.

## ModArchive tools

The ModArchive offers an application programming interface (API), for which
the `openmpt` package offers several wrappers in R. For many of these functions
you need an API key (see below)

If you know the module's database ID, you can download it (without an API key)
using

```{r modarchive-download}
library(openmpt)

unreal <- modarchive_download(60395)
unreal
```

Using the module ID you can also obtain meta-information from ModArchive
for that module.

```{r modarchive-info}
if (modarchive_api() != "") {
  info <- modarchive_info(60395)
  info$genretext
}
```

If you don't know the module ID, you can search the archive through different
entry points:

 * `modarchive_search_mod()`: search for texts in different fields
   and filter the results with specific criteria
 * `modarchive_search_genre()`: browse modules for a specific genre
   and filter the results with specific criteria
 * `modarchive_search_hash()`: search for a specific hash code
 * `modarchive_view_by()`: create different views of lists of modules

## ModArchive API key

In order to keep traffic to the ModArchive servers in fair bounds,
an API key is needed to make use of the features offered by the
ModArchive toolbox. These keys are handed out and maintained by the
ModArchive crew. In order to apply for a key, you first need to register
at the [ModArchive Forums](https://modarchive.org/forums/). Then follow the
instructions provided in
[this topic](https://modarchive.org/forums/index.php?topic=1950.0)
on the forum.

Note that there are
[different access levels](https://modarchive.org/index.php?xml-api),
where the access levels determine which features are available to you.
If ModArchive features wrapped in the `openmpt` package don't work,
you might need a higher access level.

Most wrappers (like `modarchive_search_mod()`) have an argument named
`api`. There you can pass your key directly as argument. You
can also set it as an environmental variable:
`Sys.setenv(MODARCHIVE_API = "<your api key here>")`. You can
also set it as a session option:
`options(modarchive_api = "<your api key here>")`. By setting it as
either an option or an environmental variable, you don't have to pass
it as an argument with each call. It is automatically obtained with
`modarchive_api()`.

Each API key comes with a cap on the number of monthly requests you
can make to the server. You can check how many requests you have and can
make each month with your key with `modarchive_requests()`. Below you can
how many requests where made with the key used for developing this package
at the time this vignette was rendered.

```{r modarchive-requests}
if (modarchive_api() != "")
  modarchive_requests()
```
